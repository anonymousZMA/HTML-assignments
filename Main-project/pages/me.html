        <p id="introduction-text">Hi there, I'm Zahraa, also known as the queen of humor, lover of laughter, and expert
            Netflix binge-watcher.
            When I'm not cracking jokes or snacking on popcorn, you can find me nose-deep in a good book, exploring the
            great outdoors. When I get bored I like to watch a movie or series, especially "Friends", or I like to sit
            on
            the beach and watch the waves and listen to their amazing sounds. Mmm, I'm also a writer... I prefer to vent
            my
            thoughts on paper instead of people. And finally, I'm a person who enjoys learning new things every time</p>
