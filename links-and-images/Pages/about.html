    <h1>Hello There!</h1>
    <p>Hi there, I'm Zahraa, a full-stack developer who doesn't believe in a comfort zone in this world but in hard work
        and how it leads to changing society. Specialized in math with a high degree but converted to the programming
        field and used her programming skills to offer valuable content to this universe.
        When I get bored I like to watch a movie or series, especially "Friends", or I like to sit on the beach watch
        the waves listen to its amazing sounds.Mmm I'm also a writer..I prefer to vent my thoughts to paper instead of
        people. And finally I'm a person who enjoys learning new things every time</p>
